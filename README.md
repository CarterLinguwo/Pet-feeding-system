"# Pet-feeding-system" 
This project introduces the design, implementation and experimental evaluation of an ESP32S3 based pet feeder that combines precise portion size and schedule control with environmental and hydration monitoring. A rotating paddle mechanism driven by a DC motor dispenses portion size from 1 to 10 with the SNTP synchronized feeding schedule set by the users. At the same time, a BME280 sensor tracks ambient temperature and humidity to prevent dry-food spoilage and an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor measures the water level. Users could monitor the real-time updates from the OLED display screen and the web. Through several evaluations, the system could run as expected under different settings and the ultrasonic sensor reading is considered fairly accurate.
